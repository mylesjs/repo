======== Description ========
Simple sorting algorithms to show advantages and disadvantages 
of using different coding languages. The algorithms I reflected 
on are insertion sort, merge sort, and heap sort. 

After making each file for each of the algorithms, it's shown 
how much less of lines and code is required to run some of them. 
Python only needed about half the lines of code in order to 
execute each algorithm. This is an example of how different 
languages could be an advantage over another. In this case,
Python helps to reduce time in writing the code. However, Java
being a compiled language might run certain code quicker depending
on how big of a file is being executed.
